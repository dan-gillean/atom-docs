In August 2013, in preparation for the launch of AtoM 2.0.0, `Artefactual
Systems <http://www.artefactual.com>`__, lead developers of the `AtoM
<http://www.accesstomemory.org/>`__ project, began work to rewrite all project
documentation and migrate it from a `MediaWiki
<http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki>`__ site to a new platform, using the
`Sphinx Documentation Generator <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`__ (version 1.1.3) as
the new basis for the AtoM User Manual and Administrator's Manual. `Sphinx
<http://sphinx-doc.org/>`__ is an open-source documentation generator that
uses reStructuredText (`reST
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`__)
markup format as its basis, and converts reST files into `HTML
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html>`__, `PDF
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pdf>`__, and `EPub
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB>`__ formats. Sphinx was originally
developed by George Brandl and publicly released under a `BSD
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses>`__ license in on March 21, 2008.
reStructuredText (`reST
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`__) is a
lightweight markup language used in Sphinx documentation, written in plaintext
using  simple constructs to indicate the structure of a document, and which is
human-readable in either raw (i.e. the text file itself) or processed (e.g. an
HTML document, which can then be styled by `CSS
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS>`__) form. reST was originally developed by
David Goodger and released into the public domain on April 2, 2002.

The **Access to Memory** (`AtoM <http://www.accesstomemory.org/>`__ ) project
welcomes community contributions to its documentation. All AtoM documents are
publicly released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported
licence (`CC BY SA <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>`__), and
we rely on input, contributions, and translations from our community to make
our documents as useful and accessible as they can be. Information on how to
contribute to our documentation is included :ref:`below
<about-contribute-docs>`.

1. |compass| **Consolidation**: Formerly, documentation for the AtoM project's
   earlier releases (under the name ICA-AtoM; read more about the history of
   AtoM and the ICA-AtoM project here) was broken up across several different
   `wikis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki>`__. It was not always easy for
   community members to find content, distinguish what was documentation from
   what was a development proposal, and whether or not the documentation was
   up to date or relevant to a particular release. This new documentation
   platform indicates a concerted effort by `Artefactual Systems
   <http://www.artefactual.com>`__, lead developers of the `AtoM
   <http://www.accesstomemory.org/>`__ project, to improve access to and ease
   of navigation within all project documentation and consolidate it to one
   platform.
2. |code-fork| **Versioning**: AtoM documentation is now maintained in a
   `GitHub <https://www.github.com>`__ code repository (`here
   <https://github.com/artefactual/atom-docs>`__). This allows us to fork the
   repository and create release-specific documents (e.g., 2.0.0 User Manual,
   2.1.0 User Manual, etc.), and continue to make documentation for legacy
   versions available to our community. Previously, all documentation was
   maintained on a `wiki <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki>`__; clauses were
   added for changes in newer versions and alternate screenshots for different
   themes. This made the documentation unnecessarily long and unclear to end-
   users. Now previous release documentation can be left unchanged so it
   remains relevant to the particular AtoM release, and users will be able to
   quickly locate documentation that is specific to the version of AtoM they
   are using.
3. |copy| **PDF and EPub formats**: `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`__ is
   designed to allow the generation of multiple different formats from
   reStructuredText (`reST
   <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`__),
   including Portable Document Format (`PDF
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pdf>`__) and Electronic Publication (`EPub
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB>`__). Our community users have long
   asked for documentation to be made available in PDF format - as part of our
   attempts to improve the accessibility of our documentation, we felt that
   Sphinx would allow us to meet these goals most easily. With these
   additional formats, users will be able to view and print documentation more
   easily, across a wider range of platforms and devices.

.. IMPORTANT::

   AtoM documentation is freely maintained by `Artefactual Systems
   <http://www.artefactual.com>`__, lead developers of the `AtoM
   <http://www.accesstomemory.org/>`__ project. We do our best to ensure that
   our documentation is comprehensive, but as an open-source company that
   freely gives away software, documentation, and user support in our `User's
   Forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ica-atom-users>`__, please
   keep in mind that we have to prioritize our client assignments so that we
   can pay our bills and continue to provide free software and free community
   support.  If you've submitted a suggestion for a fix to our documetation
   via `webmaster@accesstomemory.org <mailto:webmaster@accesstomemory.org>`__,
   thank you! If it takes us a bit of time to implement a fix, it may be
   because we are currently focused on a client project - we will address any
   reported issues as soon as we are able. As always with open-source
   projects, the best way to ensure a fix is implemented is to contribute the
   fix yourself - we encourage our community users to become active
   contributors to all aspects of our projects.

**WORK IN PROGRESS!**

Is there a section missing from our documentation that you'd like to see? Or a
section that you'd like to improve by adding clearer instructions, more
screenshots, or alternative workflows? Help us improve our documentation by
submitting new or revised content yourself!

The following instructions will show you how to contribute changes to our
documentation straight from our `GitHub <https://github.com/>`__ repository
(`here <https://github.com/artefactual/atom-docs/>`__), using GitHub's user
interface, which provides all the tools you need - including a text editor!
If you are a more advanced user, you can do this from your own computer using
a text editor and the command-line - see GitHub's incredibly useful
`Help <https://help.github.com/>`__ documentation for guidance.

**Before you begin, you should:**

* Create a GitHub account if you don't have one already: go to
  https://github.com/ and sign up - it's easy!
* Read our :ref:`Contribution guidelines <contribute-guide>`, below
* Familiarlize yourself with `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`__ and
  `reStructuredText
  <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`__

**An overview of the steps:**

* Log into your Github account
* Navigate to our |github| `AtoM Documentation GitHub repository
  <https://github.com/artefactual/atom-docs>`__
* :ref:`contribute-fork-atom-docs`
* :ref:`contribute-github-edit`
* :ref:`contribute-commit-changes`
* :ref:`contribute-pull-request`

.. _contribute-fork-atom-docs:

Fork the AtoM Documentation repository in GitHub
------------------------------------------------

1. First, sign into your GitHub account at https://github.com
2. Navigate to Artefactual's AtoM Documentation repository: you can do this
   through the user interface by typing *artefactual/atom-docs* into the
   search bar at the top of the page:

.. image:: images/git-atom-docs.*
   :align: center
   :width: 50%
   :alt: An image of the GitHub search bar

3. At the top of the page, click the "Fork" button. If you have more than one
   repository, you'll be given an option to choose where the fork will be
   created.

.. image:: images/git-fork.*
   :align: center
   :width: 50%
   :alt: An image of the GitHub Fork button

4. GitHub will create a copy of the entire *atom-docs* repository in your
   chosen location (or in your own new repository if this is your first time
   using GitHub). Now you can edit to your heart's content without fear of
   breaking our production website or making the documents unavailable to
   other users. At the top of the page, you'll see that now atom-docs is in
   your own repository (indicated by your chosen user name):

.. SEEALSO::

  GitHub Help has a great overview of how to fork which includes instructions
  for cloning the fork in your local machine, if you prefer to work there:
